# 6 Lessons learned
We have learned a lot about React and MongoDB through this project. React being a great tool for modular peices of the story, where each story peice uses the same HTML and alters the text through using objects. Using React in this way we made our website easy to add story modules to and have different number of options for each one. React helps make the site more edit friendly. MongoDB is the database system we used in our website. We learned both how to query the website and how to add tuples into the website. We have also learned how to use local browser storage so that a user can be remembered and have information specific to them used within the website. We have also grown greatly as a team, showing how well we can work together and helping eachother in persuit of bettering ourselves. Overall this project has been a great learning experiece in teamwork and systems to run a website.
