**Representative quotes:**

**Hypotheses that were validated:**
- Users find value in notifications of major risks/inconveniences

- Underwater, identifying underwater creatures tends to play few science fiction games, but will interact and watch others play games with these themes. 

**Are there any other suggestions you have for us?**

- “Due to lack of customization, but in some games playing as the character could cancel this out if the storyline depends on it. If the character is set up as you, and there isn’t customization available then, must have customization.”
